# metaltool
Python scripts to be used along fftool (https://github.com/paduagroup/fftool). The objective is to generate reduced topologies and forcefield parameters from the broad il.ff file provided in CL&P (https://github.com/paduagroup/clandp). The programs algo asign a different name to every atom, to ensure compatibility with the METALWALLS software (https://gitlab.com/ampere2/metalwalls)
